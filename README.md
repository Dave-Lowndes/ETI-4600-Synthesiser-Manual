# ETI 4600 Synthesiser Manual

The PDF (see the [Releases page](../../releases) ) has been created from scans of my now somewhat tatty manual (from around 1977) using [ABBYY FineReader 16 OCR Editor](https://help.abbyy.com/en-us/finereader/16/user_guide/overviewfirstpage/) software - and several passes of manual editing!

Although I've found other copies of the manual online, most are just image scans of the manual or are only searchable online. This version has been through an OCR process to make the PDF text searchable and to benefit from greatly improved text rendering. The text has been edited to fix any typos and other errors I've spotted.

The OCR of course has its limits, but overall I think the end result is much better than just a scan produces.

If you find anything you'd like correcting, please let me know by creating an issue [here](../../issues) and I'll fix it and update the PDF file.

The PDF file is quite large as the scans are done at 300dpi to get decent OCR results, though the images are limited by the original print quality.
